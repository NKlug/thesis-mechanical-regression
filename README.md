# Mechanical Regression for Supervised Learning
This is the Bachelor's thesis I wrote for my B.Sc. degree in
Mathematics during the winter term 2020/21.
In the thesis, I examined mechanical regression which was proposed by Houman Owhadi 
in the paper "Do Ideas Have Shape? Plato's Theory of Forms as the Continuous Limit of
Artificial Neural Networks" [1].
Mechanical regression is a method for supervised learning that was derived from a 
theoretical model of residual neural networks (ResNets).

This repository contains an implementation of the algorithm suggested in
section 3 in [1] (in the `python` folder) and also the LaTeX code for the thesis and 
the figures.

The following are the abstracts in English and German.
