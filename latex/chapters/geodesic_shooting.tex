\section{Algorithm: Geodesic Shooting}

Instead of $\mathbb{R}^{n\times2}$ $\mathbb{R}^{2n}$.
We utilize the Block Operator Matrix Notation, which makes calculations particularly easy as everything can be written over $\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}$ (more or less).
Proof that we can then use standard matrix multiplication.

Dataset: We use a common benchmark dataset, the Swiss Rolls Dataset.
It can be generated as two interleaved spirals, one spiral belonging to class A, the other to class B.
