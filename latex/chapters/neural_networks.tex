\section{Residual Neural Networks}
\label{sec:neural-networks}

What I want to write here/ goal of this section:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Explain how ResNets work
	\item Explain why they are used / what problem they solve
	\item Show some applications
	\item Show some examples of Block Design
	\item Los gehts!
\end{itemize}

In the early 2010s, when neural networks became increasingly popular it was still difficult to train models with many layers.
Residual Neural Networks (ResNets) have shown extraordinary success in enabling very deep network architectures.
