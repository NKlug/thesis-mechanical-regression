\section{Introduction}

Ideas on what to write here:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Neural Networks are universal approximators
	\item Why neural networks work so well \cite{lin17}
	\item It is not entirely clear why neural networks work so well. 
	They were inspired by the neurological structure of the human brain.
	No real mathematical explanation.
\end{itemize}
