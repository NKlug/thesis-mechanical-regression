\section{Conclusion}

In this thesis, chapter 3 of the paper "Do Ideas Have Shape? Plato's Theory of Forms as the Continuous Limit of Neural Networks" by Houman Owhadi has been presented.
Starting from a simplified model of ResNets, their equivalence to a discrete stationary action principle has been shown.


\subsection{Outlook}

In this thesis, only the first parts of the paper by \citet{owhadi20} could be discussed.
In the remaining chapters, the simplified ResNet model is extended to artificial neural networks.
For this, Owhadi proposes a regularization technique and adds non-linear functions, which play an essential part in practical application of neural networks.
