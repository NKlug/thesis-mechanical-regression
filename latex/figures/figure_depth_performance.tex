		Training (thin) and validation errors (bold) for a 18- and 34-layer plain network (left) and ResNet (right) for the ImageNet dataset.
		The plain 34 layer network shows worse results than the 18 layer equivalent, whereas the deeper ResNet performs better than the shallow.
		This is not the case for the plain network.
